    <u>Day 1</u>
        <li> Place a 10-well 15% TBE Urea Polyacrylamide Gel in the running chamber and fill with 1x TBE Buffer.  </li>
        <li> Clean all wells with 1x TBE Buffer and prerun the gel at 200V for 15 minutes.  </li>
        <li> While the gel preruns, prepare the gel inputs as follows:  </li>
	<ol type="a">
	   <li> 19ntfl ddC input: 3ul 100uM 19ntfl ddC DNA + 15 ul NFH2O + 18 ul 2x loading buffer.  </li>

	</ol>
        <li> Heat the inputs at 80C for 90 seconds.  </li>
        <li> Clean the gel wells one final time with 1x TBE Buffer.  </li>
        <li> Load 12ul of the prepared marker inputs into the preran 15% TBE Urea Polyacrylamide Gel. There should be 3 wells for each marker.  </li>
        <li> Run the gel at 100-115 V.  </li>
        <ol type="a">
           <li> The gel is run at a low voltage to ensure good movement. The current should be as close to 0 as possible.   </li>
           <li> The run should last &gt; 2 hours </li>

	</ol>
        <li> Cut bands out over blue light source. The method in cutting the band will greatly depend on the bands at the time of the run:  </li>
	<ol type="a">
	    <li> Smeared bands = cut closer to the top of the band.  </li>
	    <li> Markers present beneath the bands = cut closer to the top. </li>
	    <li> No bands under the gel, but in a nice, sharp line = cut the entire band.  </li>
	    <li> UV light sources should not be used when cutting.</li>
	</ol>
        <li> Combine the gel slices into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (3 per tube).  </li>
        <li> Spin the tube down using a microcentrifuge.  </li>
        <li> Crush the gel with a pestle and clean the pestle when adding 330ul gel extraction buffer.  </li>
        <li> Incubate the markers for 30 min on dry ice.  </li>
        <li> Incubate overnight covered in foil at room temperature on table top shaker or on the HulaShaker.  </li>

	<br>
	<u>Day 2</u>
        <li> Spin down the marker slurry with a microcentrifuge. </li>
        <li> Cut the tip off a low retention, DNAse and RNase free 1000 uL pipette tip with cleaned scissors and transfer all slurry to 0.22um spin filter tube.  </li>
        <li> Spin the filtered tube for 1.5 min at 13,000x G using a table top centrifuge.  </li>
        <li> Transfer the elution to a non-low bind 1.5 ml tube.  </li>
        <li> Bring volumes to 330 ul with gel extraction buffer.  </li>
        <li> To each tube, add 1.5ul glyco blue and 1 mL of cold 100% Ethanol. Cf = 300mM sodium acetate, 75% Ethanol  </li>
        <li> Allow for overnight precipitation in -20C. Note that Longer precipitation times ensure greater yield.  </li>
	<br>
	<u>Day 3 </u>
        <li> Spin the precipitated markers for 1 hour at 20,000x g with a table top centrifuge set at 4C.  </li>
        <li> Carefully remove the supernatant without disrupting the pellet.  </li>
        <li> Spin the markers a couple of times to remove any excess ethanol.  </li>
        <li> Allow the pellets to dry by storing them sideways to prevent contaminants from entering the tube. Note: do not let the pellets overdry! This is characterized by its translucent color.  </li>
        <li> Resuspend the pellets in 15 uL of nuclease free water and let sit for 10-15 minutes, or until the pellet has completely dissolved in the water.  </li>
        <li> Transfer the 15 uL of resuspended markers into a DNA Low-Bind 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. If there are multiple tubes for a single marker, combine the resuspended pellets into the same tube.
  </li>
        <li> Bring the final volumes up to 50 uL .  </li>
        <li> Heat for 2 minutes at 70 C, then immediately move to ice.  </li>
        <li>  Check concentrations on nanodrop: Example concentrations are 19ntfl ddC DNA 41.9ng/ul; A260/A280: 1.56; A260/A230: 1.27 and 36ntfl ddC DNA 73.1ng/ul; A260/A280: 1.56; A260/A230: 1.27.  </li>
        <li> Prepare 5uM stocks of the markers based on their nanodrop concentrations and molecular weights provided by the manufacturer.  </li>
        <li> Check again on nanodrop and calculate the final molarity.  </li>
        <li> Aliquot the markers into DNA Low-Bind tubes to avoid the freeze-thaw cycle.  </li>

Around 17 minutes, the first marker should be nearing the elution well. After cleaning well and exchanging the collection buffer for Diagenode Dephosphorylation Buffer (DB), sample elution is expected to take ~2 min. A typical run should take ~20-25 minutes.

	   </ol>   
	   <li> For low input ITP samples, the RTPM was used as reverse transcription primer (not the RTPH). RTPH is used when we create “bulk” ribosome profiling libraries, with 25ng inputs as starting material.  </li>
	   <li> For low input ITP samples, a 1:2 dilution of the template switching oligo was required.   </li>
	   <li> After cDNA synthesis, ½ of the cDNA (13 μL) was stored as backup (-20C or long-term at -80C). The removed 13 μL was replaced with NFH2O and PCR proceeded as written. </li>
	   <li> 17 PCR cycles were used for low-input ITP samples (using ½ of the cDNA) in both the SI (single index) and UDI (unique dual index) modules of the kit.  </li>

	    <li> A peak of ~200bp is expected when using the UDI module (~30nt inserts).  </li>

	<li> The sample peak of interest was quantified by bioanalyzer.   </li>    
        <li> Samples are pooled such that an equimolar amount of the peak-of-interest was present in the pool. 40 μL of the least-concentrated sample is used. It is ok to skip pooling of the samples when dealing with low sample numbers. However, when many samples are being processed, it is helpful to pool “like samples” before bead purification and size selection. (e.g. make a pool of all GV samples, one pool of all MII samples, etc).   </li>    
        <li> Pools of PCR products were cleaned with Ampure XP beads (1.8x ratio) and eluted in 30 μL NFH2O.  </li> 
        <li> The entire elution was size selected on a 3% agarose cassette using the Blue Pippin system, targeting either 190 or 200 bp using “tight” settings.  </li>    
        <li> The 40 μL elution was collected from blue pippin and analyzed using High Sensitivity DNA bioanalyzer. Dilution is usually not necessary for this pool, but think about your expected concentration, which depends on your original sample pool. If needed, samples can be diluted prior to checking on bioanalyzer.  </li>

  <li class="pheader" id="generalconsiderations">General considerations</li>
 

  <ol type="A">
  
    <li class="subpheader" >  Working with RNA </li>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> Thoroughly clean your bench, pipets, etc with RNase zap before starting ITP.  </li>
        <li> Aliquot stocks of reagents in order to avoid risks of RNase contamination.  </li>
        <li> Change gloves often. </li>
        <li> Always use sterile, nuclease free, filtered pipet tips with low retention.  </li>
    </ol>
    
    <li class="subpheader" >  Preparing PDMS chips </li>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
		 Some things to look out for if your PDMS chips aren’t working:
	</li>
	<ol type="a">
	    <li> If the liquid PDMS is underbaked after pouring it on the molds, it will be sticky and not bind to the glass channel properly after plasma cleaning. Ensure that the molds are not sticky after overnight incubation at 50C.   </li>
	    <li> If the edges of the channels are not properly binding to the glass after plasma cleaning, it may be time to prepare new molds. Older molds (~ 1 year old) start consistently having this problem, and replacing them with new ones immediately fixes the problem.
  </li>
	</ol>
    </ol>
    
    <li class="subpheader" >  Fluorescent markers </li>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> This protocol originally used fluorescently labeled RNA markers with 3’ ddC modifications. Despite the ddC blocking nucleotide, RNA markers consistently generated sequencing libraries (i.e negative controls just containing markers and no cellular input generated libraries; upon sequencing, these were clearly our markers). Over multiple tries, fresh RNA markers were re-ordered, single use aliquots were made, resuspension buffers were changed, etc…  Due to these issues, the switch to ssDNA markers was made.  </li>
       <li>
       The switch to fluorescently labeled DNA markers with 3’ ddC modifications was made in Jan. 2020. The library prep kit (Diagenode D-Plex) was able to amplify ssDNAs with 3’ OH groups, but not the fl-DNAs with 3’ ddC (after they were gel purified in-lab). Again, since the synthesis companies aren’t able to guarantee 100% purity, it was required to gel purify the markers in house in order to gain higher purity (oligos with lengths n-1 or n-2 are the most common contaminants, which means the most common contaminants lack the 3’ ddC). When gel purifying, only the top ½ of the fluorescent band was extracted to remove ddC-lacking species in stock solutions.
       </li>
    </ol>   
    <li class="subpheader" >  Nucleases &amp; nuclease inhibition </li>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> Aliquot single-use vials of MNase to avoid freeze thaw cycles.  </li>
	<li> It would be great to enhance flexibility in the future by figuring out how to get ITP to work with different nucleases. Since MNase relies on Ca++ for function, EGTA (calcium quencher) served as an effective MNase inhibitor, and only minorly effected size selection/yield at Cf=10mM in ITP. Other nucleases, however, would need different inhibitors.   </li>

            <li> We found that VRC migrated just ahead of our RPFs and was present in our collection fractions. VRC is known to inhibit downstream enzymatic reactions.   </li>
            <li> We tested proteinase K and found that it altered the digestion profile of our RNA samples. We think that it begins digesting the ribosome prior to fully inhibiting the nuclease, resulting in changes to the RNA profile (overdigestion).  </li>

           <li> One can run an RNA of choice (small RNA ladder or pre-digested/extracted RNA containing RPFs) through ITP and compare check yield on a gel, as compared to the input RNA. Can also assess size selection (exclusion of unwanted small/large fragments; yield of target fragments).  </li>

           <li> The first attempt with actual cells should be the 100 K562 cells (dilution method described in protocol).   </li>

  <!-- GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ENDS  -->









  <li class="pheader" id="otherconsiderations">Other considerations</li>
  <ol type="1">
     <li> pH is very important in ITP.  </li>
     <ol type="a">
         <li> Buffers have been optimized to have pH around 7.2. If the pH of buffers is incorrect, check the pH of the BisTris-HCl Master Mix and ensure it is at 7.2.  </li>
         <li> If size selection is poor or ITP seems to be running poorly, check the pH of your solutions; especially the lab-made ones.  </li>
     </ol>
     <li> Aliquots are your best friend. They help avoid RNase contamination, freeze thaw cycling, etc.  </li>
     <li> Our protocol uses 1.5 μL of each 1μM fl-DNA marker. This can be hard to see, but we use this small amount in order to minimize risk of converting these to libraries. Marker amount can be scaled up depending on application.  </li>
