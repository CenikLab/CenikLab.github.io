Protein abundance is governed by the complex interplay between RNA expression and post-transcriptional processes including translation. In a typical eukaryotic cell, a particular gene might be expressed at an absolute mRNA copy number of a single molecule to ~1000 molecules. Yet, the dynamic range of proteins in individual cells is ~100 â€“ 1,000,000 copies. This observation along with the knowledge of mRNA and protein stability coefficients imply that translation efficiency, i.e. the number of proteins synthesized per mRNA, is a major contributor to determining protein abundance. However, we currently have a limited understanding of the variability in translation efficiencies across genes in different biological contexts. While a few specific differences in genetic sequences (cis- regulatory elements) and global regulators of gene-specific translation rates (trans- regulatory elements) have been discovered, our understanding remains far from complete. This gap in our knowledge is predominantly attributable to lack of quantitative scalable experimental methods to measure the impact of cis- and trans- elements on translation in a transcriptome-wide across broad biological contexts. Our long-term goal is to develop the necessary computational and experimental framework that will enable quantitative and reproducible determination of the role of translational control in a scalable manner across all transcripts.
