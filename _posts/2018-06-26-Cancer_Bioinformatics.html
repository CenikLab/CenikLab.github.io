title: Characterize translation machinery alterations in thousands of tumors of diverse origins
image: /img/CancerBioinformatics.jpg
html: True
summary: Recurrent cancer mutations that disrupt protein-coding regions have been identified through large-scale projects employing targeted sequencing strategies such as whole exome sequencing. While our previous work demonstrated that exome sequencing can reveal critical noncoding mutations in cancer, much of the genome remains inaccessible to analyses when targeted sequencing approaches are employed. Our lab develops computational methods to analyze cancer genomics data with an initial focus on alterations of the translation components.
