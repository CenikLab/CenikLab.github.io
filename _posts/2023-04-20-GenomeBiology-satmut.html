<p>
Addressing the lack of standardized, scalable software for Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVEs), we introduce 'satmut_utils', a flexible, high-performance tool for variant simulation and quantification, demonstrating its effectiveness with simulated and real MAVE data, and utilizing it to analyze mRNA abundance variations across thousands of cystathionine beta-synthase variants.
