title: Determine cis-regulatory translation control elements in the human genome

Lack of sensitive methods limits our ability to characterize a potentially large class of regulatory variants that modulate translation. A major objective in our lab is to develop a suite of experimental and computational tools that will identify cis-acting genetic regulators of translation.
