title: Determine cis-regulatory translation control elements in the human genome

Regulatory proteins control translation by scaling global protein production and by modulating translation from specific mRNAs. Targeted approaches continue to reveal new translation regulatory proteins, however there is currently no genome-wide functional genomics approach to identify translation control factors. Our laboratory will address this fundamental gap by devising an assay that quantifies translation activity (i.e. ratio of polypeptide synthesis to mRNA levels) of single cells and coupling this assay with genome-scale CRISPR based functional genomics.
