    Ribo-ITP is a novel strategy that leverages the principles of microfluidics and isotachophoresis (ITP) to
    fundamentally alter how we isolate ribosome footprints. Specifically, we have designed and manufactured a custom
    microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane chip to enable simultaneous purification and size selection of RNA fragments using
    a combination of sieving matrices and ITP, a specialized technique for separation and concentration of small
    molecules via a nonlinear electrophoretic field. In this study, we have applied Ribo-ITP to characterize translation
    changes during mouse preimplantation development. The ability to measure ribosome occupancy from single cells and
    embryos using a sequencing-based ap-proach has uniquely enabled us to characterize allele-specific translation. We
    used two inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ mice and leveraging strain-specific single nucleo-tide
    polymorphisms (SNPs), we were able to assign the parent-of-origin for >230k unique ribosome protected footprints.
