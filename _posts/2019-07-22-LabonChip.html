<p>
In this study, we establish the feasibility of using isotachophoresis for simultaneous RNA purification and size selection. We designed and fabricated a chip for this purpose. We demonstrated several advantages of this novel approach over conventional gel electrophoresis. This study is the first step towards a method that can enable translation profiling from ultra low input samples.
