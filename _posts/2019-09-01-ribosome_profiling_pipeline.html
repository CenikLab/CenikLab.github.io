title: Ribosome Profiling Analyses Tools (riboflow, ribopy, ribor) available  on Github 
html: True
summary: We released the first version of our ribosome profiling analyses tools.  
--- 
<p>
Our ribosome profiling analyses tools are available on <a href="https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/">github</a>. 
These include a Nextflow-based preprocessing pipeline as well as 
a new binary file format for organizing ribosome profiling data as a function of footprint length. 
This file format leverages hierarchical data format and is akin to binary file formats commonly used in bioinformatics 
(.bam for sequence alignments, cooler for Hi-C, etc). We also provide a complete R package (riboR), 
a Python interface (RiboPy) and a command line interface.
