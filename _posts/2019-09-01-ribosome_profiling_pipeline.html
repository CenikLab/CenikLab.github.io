title: Ribosome Profiling Analyses Tools (RiboFlow, RiboPy, RiboR) available  on Github 
html: True
summary: We released the first version of our ribosome profiling analyses tools.  
--- 
<p>
Our ribosome profiling analyses tools are available on <a href="https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/">github</a>. 
These include 
 <a href="https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/riboflow">a Nextflow-based preprocessing pipeline</a> as well as 
a new binary file format for organizing ribosome profiling data as a function of footprint length. 
  <a href="https://ribopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ribo_file_format.html">This file format</a> 
  leverages hierarchical data format and is akin to binary file formats commonly used in bioinformatics 
(.bam for sequence alignments, cooler for Hi-C, etc). We also provide a complete R package 
(<a href="https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/ribor">riboR</a>), 
a Python interface 
(<a href="https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/ribopy">RiboPy</a>) and 
  <a href="https://ribopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html">a command line interface</a>.
