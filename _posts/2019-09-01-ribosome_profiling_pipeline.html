title: Ribosome Profiling Analyses Tools (riboflow, ribopy, ribor) available  on Github 
html: True
summary: We released the first version of our ribosome profiling analyses tools.  
--- 
<p>
Our ribosome profiling analyses tools are available on [github](https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/). These include a Nextflow-based preprocessing pipeline as well as a new binary file format for organizing ribosome profiling data as a function of footprint length. This file format leverages hierarchical data format and is akin to binary file formats commonly used in bioinformatics (.bam for sequence alignments, cooler for Hi-C, etc). We also provide a complete R package (riboR), a python interface (ribopy) and a CLI.
