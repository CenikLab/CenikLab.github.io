The Center for Excellence in Education (CEE) gave our summer intern student, Amber Luo, Research Science Institute (RSI) award for top oral and written presentations. During her internship, Amber developed a novel algorithm to detect ribosome pause sites. Amber used Bayesian wavelet thresholding techniques to distinguish ribosome footprint pile-ups from the backgorund signal.

We congratulate Amber for her remarkable success!
