In a wonderful collaboration with <a href="https://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/person/alexander-f-palazzo/" Palazzo Lab,</a> we used ribosome profiling to demonstrate that PKM expression influences translation dynamics. Specifically, we observed significant changes on translational stalling near lysine and glutamate encoding sequencing. This also also revelaed that PKM recruitment to polysomes is dependent on poly-ADP ribosylation activity.
