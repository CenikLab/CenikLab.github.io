summary: PKM binds ribosomes in a poly-ADP ribosylation dependent manner to induce translational stalling
---

<p>
In a wonderful collaboration with <a href="https://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/person/alexander-f-palazzo/"> the Palazzo Lab,</a> we used ribosome profiling to demonstrate that PKM expression influences translation dynamics. Specifically, we observed significant changes on translational stalling near lysine and glutamate encoding sequencing. This also also revelaed that PKM recruitment to polysomes is dependent on poly-ADP ribosylation activity.
