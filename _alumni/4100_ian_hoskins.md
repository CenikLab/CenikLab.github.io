Ian is passionate about genomics, statistics, and microbiology. 
His general research goals involve the application of statistical learning approaches to sequencing data. 
Outside of work, Ian likes to play acoustic and electric guitar, contend in foosball matches, and exercise throughkickboxing and longboarding. 
When Ian feels like being less physically active, you'll find him critically examining political and philosophicaldebates and reading all sorts of nonfiction- from religious history to particle physics. 
Ian has a "peacemaker" personality and is very laid-back, so don't be hesitant to say "hi".
