description:
   "My research focuses on the development of ribosome profiling methods for unconventional samples: for example, ultra-low inputs and circulating cancer stem cells. I am a medical school applicant with interests in neonatology and public health. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing piano, boxing, and wakeboarding."
