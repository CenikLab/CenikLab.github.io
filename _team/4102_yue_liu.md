description:
   Yue is interested in cancer and computational biology. Her research goal involves applying
   computational methods to cancer research. She used to work on how DNA damage response
   affects cancer metabolism with targeted CRISPR-screen. With both wet and dry lab experience,
   she is interested in developing bioinformatics applications that benefit bench work. 
   She loves to go hiking and play the violin when she is not working.
