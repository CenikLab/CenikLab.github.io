description:
  Currently, Shilpa is working on identifying novel translation regulators using genome-wide CRISPR
  screens in humans. Her doctoral study involved understanding translation regulation in the
  human parasite, Leishmania donovani. She would like to combine the two in future and
  identify factors that can be used for drug targeting and treat various pathogenesis. 
  In her free time, being with her kids gives Shilpa immense joy.
