# Overview


**Our long-term goal is to develop the necessary computational and experimental framework for predictive models that explain how cells determine their protein abundance.** Achieving this goal involves two major components:  (1) higher-resolution and higher-precision measurements of various gene expression modalities, and (2) computational and theoretical advancements capable of integrating these quantitative measurements into cohesive, predictive frameworks.
