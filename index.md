# Overview

Protein abundance is governed by the complex interplay between RNA expression and post-transcriptional processes, including translation. 

In a typical eukaryotic cell, a particular gene might be measured to have expressed anywhere from 1 to ~1000 mRNA molecules. Yet, the dynamic range of proteins in individual cells is ~100 â€“ 1,000,000 copies. Translation efficiency, i.e. the number of proteins synthesized per mRNA, is a major contributor to determining protein abundance. 

**Our long-term goal is to develop the necessary computational and experimental framework that will enable quantitative and reproducible determination of translational control.**
